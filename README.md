# scratch_tweeter
This is a Twitter clone called Tweeter. The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with making MEAN stack apps. 

This is my second attempt because after getting my first one up and running, I broke it and couldn't figure out where. Instead of spending a lot of time debugging a fairly simple app, I decided to start from scratch. 

You'll notice the unusually large number of commits in this project. That is because this is also a tutorial, for myself or anyone who would care to take a look, and the commits serve as a step by step guide through the creation process. 

The repo is organized by way of tutorial in that:

1. I create a file, code it and heavily comment it;

2. That file is then committed to the master;

3. The comments are deleted and I start back at number one. 

In this way, if you start at the very beginning of this repo and follow along through the commits, each new version of the files will not only contain new code, but also comments explaining why it's there and what it's doing. 

At the end of the project I will create a branch that will serve as the completed master. 

Feel free to share your thoughts or ideas, this project is just a fun little exercise so I'm open to any and all feedback you have for me. 

To run this project you'll need:

1. MEAN stack
   -You can download MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js from Git, command line or their respective websites
   -Or you can download the whole package +some frills from the MEAN stack Git
2. Dependencies
   -When the project is through, I'll add a list of dependencies here
   -Until then, the dependencies are listed in package.json
