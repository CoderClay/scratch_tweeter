<!--Here is where we flex our Angular muscles by creating our single page app.
Right now we have three views: main, register and login and we can access them
by changing the URL, but why do that when we have Angular.js at our fingertips?
We are going to set this page as our applications 'view window' and set
[main, register and login] to be called as partials into this page. This allows
us to have one URL, but multiple views.-->
